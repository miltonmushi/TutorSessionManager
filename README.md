# Tutor Session Management System

A Java console application that manages students and tutoring sessions using clean **Object-Oriented Programming*** principles and the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.

## 📌 Project Overview
The Tutor Session Management System allows a tutor to:
- Register students
- Schedule tutoring sessions
- Prevent duplicate sessions on the same date
- Mark sessions as completed
- Persist data using file storage
- Safely handle invalid user input

The project focuses on **clean design, maintainability and defensive programming**.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)
- MVC Architecture
- Java Packages
- Collections (`ArrayList`)
- `LocalDate` for safe date handling
- File I/O for data persistence
- Input validation and error handling
- Method overriding (`toString()`)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Java
- Standard Java Libraries
- Console-based UI
